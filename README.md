## Wins and Challenges
[] Aim for minimum 60% test coverage (In future projects this will be enforced with an aim for 80%)
[] Your website should be deployed (You could use eg. Netlify for client, Heroku for server)
[] You may bring in some node libraries for specialised behaviour eg. dayjs but no large front end frameworks such as React.
[] Your website should not have a database connected, instead any data sent and stored in your backend should be saved within .json files.
